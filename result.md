# First Appeal Case Summary

This is a First and final Appeal.

This case involves an appeal filed by Sunrise Industrial Builders against the State Urban Development Authority under Section 52-B of the Urban Land Regulation Act, 1976. The appeal challenges the order dated 14.08.2023 passed in case number 1142/2023.

The appellant claims that the land acquisition notice was issued without proper verification of land classification records. According to the appellant, the land was recorded as mixed-use agricultural land under the State Land Records Manual, and therefore should not have been categorized under industrial acquisition priority zones.

The appellant further argues that the compensation calculation was based on nearby commercial land transactions, which is not an appropriate benchmark. The appellant cites the case of Sharma vs State Development Board (2012), where the court held that agricultural utility and historical land usage must be primary factors in valuation.

The appeal was filed on 21.09.2025 before the Regional Land Tribunal, New Delhi. The tribunal has reviewed preliminary submissions and supporting land registry documents provided by both parties.
